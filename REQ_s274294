# Abstract
Each gas station in Italy is free to define the price of fuels (regular gasoline, premium gasoline,
diesel). Drivers are interested in finding as easily as possible the closest gas station with the
cheapest price.


# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| Localization service |The smartphone app shows the gas stations in the area of the driver |
| Administrator     |Uses the application to manage location and price| 
| User (driver)        |A driver first has to sign in to access the service. |

# Stories and personas
The user can customize what is shown (for instance show all gas stations and all prices, or only gas
stations that have prices below average, show all prices or only gasoline / only diesel).
The user can then select a gas station and ask directions to it (navigation function). The navigation
function is external (for instance uses a Google navigation service).
The prices are collected by the drivers themselves. So a function must be available for users to
communicate to the application the prices of a certain gas station. Therefore a price has a time tag,
and an obsolescence property too. The application has to manage somehow the reliability of prices,
in terms both of obsolescence, and trust of users that communicate the prices. Trust of users is
evaluated by reports or votes of other users (for instance if a user reports that the price of gas
station X is wrong, and user U has communicated that price recently, then the trust of U lowers.
# Functional and non functional requirements

## Functional Requirements

| ID        | Description  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  FR1     | User management: CRUD User, authorize and authenticate |  
|  FR2     |User trust: compute trust of user using the trust of his/her price reports |
|  FR3     | Gas station management: CRUD Gas station |
|  FR4     | Price report management. CRUD Price report, attach price report to user |
|  FR5     | Price management. CRUD price management, compute price starting from(recent) price reports of a station, compute level of trust of the price reportSignal price is correct / incorrect |
|  FR6     | Navigation. Compute path from position of user to defined gas station |
|  FR7     | Show gas stations and their fuel prices on a map, customizable by area, fuel type |


## Non Functional Requirements

| ID        | Type (efficiency, reliability, .. see iso 9126)           | Description  | Refers to |
